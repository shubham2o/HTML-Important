      • The div tag does not have height of its own, it only has its width. The
      height of the div depends upon its children. For example, If a div has 3
      children of height 10px, 20px, 30px, then the height of the div will be
      60px.

      • In HTML, one or more id cannot have the same name but the class can have
      the same name because ids are unique in HTML. They should be different
      from the others.
